Floods were registered in the municipalities of San Felipe, Santa Cruz Muluá, San Martín Zapotitlán, Mazatenango’s urban centre, Colotenango’s urban centre, Calle de la Cruz, Callejón 10, Campo Borrayo, and the cantons of Icán, La otra banda and Tulula, among other areas. When the Guatemalan Red Cross Damage Analysis and Needs Assessment (DANA) teams were deployed to the departments of Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez, the departmental delegate from CONRED reported that the flooding affected 629 people, forced 164 people to evacuate from their homes and 97 people to seek shelter in collective centres, damaged 68 roads and impacted 1 bridge in the departments of Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez.  \r\n\r\nIn the departments of Suchitepéquez and Retalhuleu, floods have damaged homes, crops and household goods. Around 2,016 families are affected according to local authorities.  \r\n\r\nThe flood-stricken families preferred to find their own shelter since the collective centres assigned by local authorities do not have electricity, running water, toilets, showers or kitchens, and are far away from people’s homes; the loss of bedding, clothing, blankets and the necessary tools for their livelihoods, among other items has also prompted affected people to seek their own shelter to safeguard the few belongings they still have left.    \r\n\r\nLocal authorities have declared an orange level for the departments of Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez to be able to provide emergency assistance to the affected areas, and on September 27 2017, CONRED declared Red Alert in Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez, to provide assistance to the local emergencies.

As of 31 October 2017, 13 collective centres have been opened to house more than 999 people, whose homes were directly affected.  \r\nAlta Verapaz is one of the largest maize producers in Guatemala, accounting for 10 per cent of the total production in the country; however, crops are being lost to the flooding, which puts small and medium-sized farmers’ food security at risk for the next few months, according to information provided by the Guatemalan Red Cross (GRC) branch in Cobán. Per official reports, 450 hectares owned by 1,097 families have been affected in the municipality of Chisec, Raxruhá and Panzós.

The United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR)-Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT) estimates that 10,074,699 people were living in regions that were exposed to wind speeds of 120 km/h or more, and that some districts near Cox’s Bazaar and Chittagong were hit with gusts that topped 130 km/h. \r\n\r\nThere were at least six lives lost, as well as 136 people injured, according to the National Health Crisis Management Centre and Control Room of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). Government sources have estimated that approximately 52,000 houses were damaged or destroyed, leaving 260,000 people in possible need of shelter. In particular, Cox’s Bazaar district was heavily hit, with approximately 17,000 residences damaged. Housing for undocumented Myanmar nationals near Cox’s Bazaar was severely damaged. Rohingya refugees are currently without reliable shelter, food, and fuel. ([UN RC, 31 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2055354))\r\n\r\nAn estimated 3.3 million people have been affected by Tropical Cyclone MORA, which made landfall in Chittagong Division on 30 May...As of 3 June, 540,000 people are estimated to require humanitarian assistance.

These facilities had been supporting 13,437 children in makeshift settlements and host communities. According to UNICEF, children are at risk of exploitation, abuse and violation, as they are taking shelter with people who are not their immediate family members. Caregivers are busy collecting relief and restoring livelihoods; as a result, children are often left unattended for long periods. This could increase their vulnerability and exposure to risks.

Complicating the issue are the decades of protracted tension and communal violence in Rakhine state, where the cyclone hit. Access to some areas, including by humanitarian organizations, remains constricted. Although authorities have allowed some organizations to conduct needs assessments in Maungdaw and Buthidaung, the data is still to be verified and a comprehensive assessment has not been conducted, according to the IFRC.

Taking into account the speed at which the worms spread, it is highly likely that other neighbouring provinces, especially Nord-Kivu, Ituri, Maniema and Kasai, are already affected. The extent of the spread would result in a significant impact on the local corn production (FEWSNET 28/02/2017).[(ACAPS, 23 Mar 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1956929))      \r\nAs of August 2017, the spread of fall armyworms has destroyed crops in 50 out of the country’s 145 territories. Between 50 to 80 percent of people in some of the areas affected by hunger struggle to make ends meet and to have something to eat. [(WFP, FAO, 14 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2168224))        \r\nThe number of acutely food insecure people from June to December 2017 has risen by almost 2 million since the same period in 2016. Conflict is causing widespread insecurity and population displacements in North Kivu, South Kivu, Ituri, Tanganyika, Haut-Katanga and Kasai provinces. As of October 2017, 3.9 million people were internally displaced, more than 1.3 million in Kasai. Many people are eating little more than a meal a day – typically just maize or cassava root and leaves. Crops have been destroyed, production areas and market routes cut off, huge numbers of farmers displaced and planting areas severely reduced. Crop production has been affected by pest attacks such as the Fall Armyworm, which has a ected more than 80 territories. The depreciation of the local currency has resulted in more expensive and reduced imports. This, combined with limited domestic food supplies, has pushed up cereal prices. ([FAO, 16 Jan 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/node/2417944))          \r\nConflict related reduction in area planted as well as destruction from the Fall Army Worm (FAW) infestation are expected to contribute towards below average 2017 crop. Both factors will likely remain relevant through the early part of 2018 and consequently result in weak expectations for 2018 harvests.

In Ashanti, some 6,400 hectares of cocoa farms have also been affected. Although the infestations occur every year, experts say that this year’s outbreak is unprecedented and have urged quick action to curb further destruction as food security and livelihoods of several households is threatened. Officials from the National Disaster Management Organisation have begun distributing pesticides and a national taskforce has been set up to oversee the control of the infestation. [(OCHA, 22 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2040989))  \r\n\r\nIn **Cameroon**, as of late August, the Ministry of Agriculture  informed that the fall armyworm pest had infested 6 of the central African state’s 10 regions. Armyworms have been a serious threat to food security in the country because cereals like maize, sorghum, rice and legume plants like cow-pea, peanuts and beans are increasingly being attacked every day.

The objective of the TCP includes the establishment of capacities to detect, monitor and control the FAW infestation in maize production. The project is expected to improve national capacities for Fall Armyworm surveillance and monitoring in affected areas, the establishment of Public Awareness on FAW, strengthen national capacities for FAW management, restore productive capacity and enhance livelihood in the worst affected households.

The majority of the affected population are nomadic pastoralists who have direct contact with blood or organs of the infected animals, or any other body fluid delivered from infected animals(milk). The larval mosquito bites and the blood-sucking flies (blood-feeding) can also transmit the virus. The population at risk are estimated at 124,337 so far. This number might increase due to the fact that the majority of the group at risk (pastoralists) are reluctant to seek medical assistance and are always on the move.

This will temporarily alleviate water shortages for human and animal use in some areas, but the damage done to the Maha crop is irreversible and there is continued concern for the subsequent Yala season due to the still very low water levels in reservoirs (73 major reservoirs stand at only 28% of their capacity). Based on historical trends, the combined production of staple crops foreseen from the two 2017 harvests is expected to result in the worst rice production levels in the last 10 years.

On 30 July, Cyclone Komen made landfall in Bangladesh, bringing strong winds and additional heavy rains to the country, which resulted in widespread flooding across 12 of the country’s 14 states and regions (Ayeyarwady, Bago, Chin, Kachin, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, Rakhine, Sagaing, Shan, Yangon). On 31 July, the President declared Chin and Rakhine states, and Magway and Sagaing regions as natural disaster zones.\r\n\r\nAccording to the National Natural Disaster Management Committee (NNDMC), 125 people were killed and some 1.7 million people were temporarily displaced by floods and landslides. Almost all of the displaced people had returned to their villages of origin by the end of September, leaving only about 10,000 people in evacuation centres (mainly in Sagaing Region and Chin State) awaiting relocation. The Government has said it expects most of these remaining displaced people to return to their villages of origin or to be relocated by the end of October, although a portion of these people may be in temporary accommodation for longer, particularly in the case of people who are going to be permanently relocated to new sites.\r\n\r\nThe NNDMC identified Hakha in Chin State, Kale in Sagaing Region, Pwintbyu in Magway Region, and Minbya and Mrauk-U in Rakhine as the five most affected townships where a total of 229,600 people were affected by the floods. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, over 1.1 million acres of farmlands have been inundated, with more than 872,000 acres destroyed, as of 4 October. So far, 495,000 acres have since been re-cultivated. Damage to crops and arable land will disrupt the planting season and pose a risk to long-term food security.\r\n\r\nWhile the water has receded in most areas, many roads and bridges were destroyed in the worst affected states and regions. The roads in Chin State were particularly badly affected and continue to pose a major logistical challenge for assessments and assistance delivery.\r\n\r\nMulti-sectoral Initial Rapid Assessments (MIRA) were conducted in 317 locations of 34 townships in Ayeyarwady, Bago, Chin, Magway, Rakhine and Sagaing, covering close to 200,000 people. Other needs assessments were also carried out in areas not covered by the MIRA assessments in Chin and Rakhine states. According to the Rakhine State Government (RSG), Buthidaung, Kyauktaw, Minbya, Maungdaw and Mrauk-U townships were the most severely affected areas in Rakhine State. In many parts of Rahine State, floods and salt water severely damaged the paddy fields. A major concern remains water contamination, as most villages use water ponds for drinking water and many ponds were flooded and contaminated.([OCHA, 4 Nov 2015](https://reliefweb.int/node/1248751))\r\n\r\nSix months on from the devastating floods that struck Myanmar, around 400,000 people have received emergency assistance and support in their recovery from the Myanmar Red Cross Society and its partners in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. At their peak the floods affected over 9 million people across 12 of Myanmar’s 14 states and regions. The floods temporarily displaced over 1.7 million people and destroyed 15,000 homes as well as more than 840,000 acres of agricultural crops.\r\n\r\nBetween July 2015 and January 2016, over 1,400 Red Cross volunteers and staff from the Myanmar Red Cross Society and Red Cross partners assisted flood affected people across the country. The first phase included evacuations, providing emergency relief such as purified water, food, household items, and shelter materials. Since then, efforts have been focused on supporting the longer term recovery of flood affected communities across the five worst hit regions of Chin, Rakhine, Sagaing, Magway and Ayerwady with livelihood activities, cleaning of contaminated ponds and wells and infrastructure rehabilitation.

The rains experienced in late March and early April provided some relief to livestock farmers, but arrived too late for both staple foods and cash crops. These adverse weather conditions are likely to reduce crop production in southern **Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Malawi, Madagascar and South Africa**. The negative impact of flooding will also affect food security in Malawi, Madagascar and Mozambique. ([OCHA, 29 May 2015](https://reliefweb.int/node/1013361))\r\n\r\nNearly 29 million people are currently food insecure in southern Africa region mainly due to the carry-over effects of the past poor harvest season combined with other structural factors. Unless a two-track approach is quickly taken to address the current food insecurity and to establish measures to mitigate against the El Niño effects, the existing food insecurity will deepen and increase in scope with its effects will last till 2017. ([Southern African Food and Nutrition Security Working Group, 17 Nov 2015](https://reliefweb.int/node/1266761))\r\n\r\nThe combination of a poor 2014/15 season and an extreme early dry spell during the 2015/16 rainy season to date (November to February) over southern and western Madagascar has resulted in an intense drought...It is now estimated that close to 1.14 million people are food insecure in seven districts of southern Madagascar (80% of the population).

This left more than 2.8 million people in Malawi food insecure for a period of between three to 8 months. 25 out of the 28 Districts in Malawi were affected. Of the 2.8 million people affected 886,204 were living in the hard hit flood-affected districts and 1,947,008 were in districts affected by poor rainfall. An estimated 20% to 40% of Malawi’s population were at that time reported to be in need of humanitarian assistance to help them cope with the acute food shortage. On 12 April 2016, the President of Malawi declared a state of national disaster as a result of prolonged dry spells during 2015/2016 season.

The recent 2016 assessment done by the office of the Prime Minister and Ministry of Agriculture estimated that 729,134 people were food insecure and 595,839 need immediate assistance due to the drought situation. Prolonged dry spells and extensive flooding characterized the planting season and resulted in delayed planting and destroyed crops. As a result, the 2014/15 crop production yields were 46% below average which put parts of country at high risk of food insecurity.

The Action Plan prioritized seven countries: Angola, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. The Action Plan was based on three pillars: a humanitarian pillar, setting out immediate needs in the seven priority countries; a resilience pillar undertaken in parallel to humanitarian efforts; and a macro-economic pillar, which sets out policy options for governments to address the long-term impacts. The plan requested $1.3 billion to provide humanitarian assistance (pillar 1) for 13.8 million people up to April 2017, of which $900 million has been received (70 per cent).

Those affects are now emerging in other areas of the country, specifically in Jubaland in the south. Somaliland and Puntland have experienced below average rains for up to four seasons, spanning two years, and affecting nearly 1.4 million people. ([OCHA, 28 Nov 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1796964))\r\n\r\nThe humanitarian situation in Somalia is rapidly deteriorating and famine is a strong possibility in 2017. This comes only six years after a devastating famine led to the death of more than a quarter of a million people – half of them children. The severe drought is a result of two consecutive seasons of poor rainfall, more in some areas. In the worst affected areas, large-scale crop failure and high levels of livestock deaths are occurring. Malnutrition and drought-related diseases are on the rise, so are displacements, including to Ethiopia. Increasing competition for resources such as water is already increasing local tensions and could trigger further inter-communal conflict. Over 6.2 million people-half the population-are in need of humanitarian assistance. The situation of children of Somalia is particularly grave. ([OCHA, 17 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1907713))\r\n\r\nAs of 31 May 2017, there had been an estimated 739,000 drought displacements since November 2016...More than 480,000 of the displaced, or 65 per cent, are under the age of 18. Moreover, people under 5 years old represent more than one-quarter (195,000) of all those displaced — and are the most at risk of malnutrition and disease. ([UNHCR, 31 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2068029))\r\n\r\n3.2 million people are severely food insecure. This situation is expected to persist throughout 2017 given the high likelihood of a third consecutive poor harvest in July. Access to food is relatively better than previously projected due to large-scale humanitarian assistance...102,263 people have been treated for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) since January. SAM admissions have increased by more than 50% since 2016. The Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU)’s post-Jilaal 2017 survey indicates a high prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (15% to 30%) in the Bay, Bakool, Sool, Sanaag, Bari and Nugal regions, as well as in Baidoa and Mogadishu IDP camps. ([OCHA, 16 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2084594))\r\n\r\nWhile the latest FSNAU assessments show a decrease of the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance from 6.7 million to 6.2 million people, the threat of localized famine countered by scaled-up humanitarian response is as relevant today as it was in the first months of this crisis. The Gu harvest will provide temporary relief for some communities in terms of food availability, but the harvest is reduced due to poor rains and access to food remains constrained. Prices will remain elevated through at least early 2018. Malnutrition, one of the leading indicators of the crisis, has reached emergency levels in a number of locations in southern and central Somalia, primarily, though not exclusively among displaced populations. Overall, some 388,000 acutely malnourished children are in need of critical nutrition support, including life-saving treatment for more than 87,000 severely malnourished children. Nearly 895,000 internally displaced people due to drought and conflict rely almost exclusively on assistance for basic services and life support. Major AWD/Cholera and measles outbreaks are also of continued concern. Through robust humanitarian assistance and the modest benefits from the underperforming Gu rains, the situation has stabilized but remains of serious concern at emergency levels. Whereas there is a modest decline in the number of people in need, there is an increase in the number of persons in the emergency-phase (IPC 4) compared to the previous assessment. When the threat of famine was announced in February, the number of people in need stood at 6.2 million. ([OCHA, 31 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2197699))\r\n\r\nHumanitarian partners are closely following what could become another failed rainy season in a context of continued risk of famine and deteriorating humanitarian indicators. According to the October Rainfall Update for Somalia by the FAO-managed Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM), the Deyr 2017 rainy season, which usually runs from October to December, kicked off in the last week of September in the north eastern areas and second week of October in southern and central regions. Many places in Bay, Bakool, Gedo and Middle Juba received rains at the start of the season. ([OCHA, 30 Oct 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2299179))\r\n\r\nFood security is expected to improve for agricultural and agropastoral households in January with the Deyr harvest. In both areas, though, improvements will be short‐lived and many households will face food consumption gaps through mid‐2018. In a worst‐case scenario of an extended absence of assistance, Famine (IPC Phase 5) remains possible, and continued large‐scale assistance is needed throughout 2018 to protect lives and livelihoods. ([FEWSNET, 30 Dec 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2397224))\r\n\r\nFood security has improved significantly in many of the areas worstaffected by the 2016/17 drought, as a result of large-scale humanitarian assistance and improvements in seasonal performance. Most areas of the country are currently Stressed (IPC Phase 2), though Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes exist in some areas and among IDP populations. Between July and September, in the absence of continued humanitarian assistance, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely in riverine livelihood zones and northern and central Somalia. Emergency (IPC Phase 4) is likely in Guban Pastoral livelihood zone. ([FEWSNET, 30 Jun 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2677274))\r\n\r\nThe record levels of rainfall seen during the April – June Gu rainy season have ushered in hopes of the substantial replenishment of water resources, and the restoration of cropland and livestock numbers across many areas of Somalia. The latest food security outlook by the Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWSNET) and the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) reports that food security will improve significantly in many of the areas worst-affected by the 2016/17 drought, as a result of improvements in seasonal performance supported by large-scale humanitarian assistance. However, the magnitude and intensity of the rains, coupled with the subsequent flooding, has aggravated vulnerabilities. Vulnerable communities, still recovering from the adverse effects of protracted drought, are among those who have been most severely affected by flooding. ([OCHA, 05 Jul 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2685429))\r\n\r\nDue to the above-average rains in the first half of 2018 and sustained humanitarian assistance, the number of people facing severe food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 and above) has decreased by 52 per cent from 3.1 million in September 2017 to 1.5 million in September 2018. However, the IPC Phase 2 caseload remained virtually unchanged, with a reduction of only 0.6 per cent. Due to the mid-2018 Gu rainy season, total cereal production exceeded the long-term average (1995-2017) by approximately 17 per cent and is 58 per cent higher than the five-year average (2013-17). Favourable rainfall between April and June 2018 also improved pasture and water availability for livestock and bolstered market conditions in some areas. Notwithstanding the relative improvement in food security outcomes since the end of the 2016/17 drought, similar gains were not observed with respect to malnutrition, which is influenced by several factors, including healthcare, clean water, proper sanitation and good hygiene practices. Malnutrition rates across Somalia remain very high and, in 2019, nearly 1 million children will be acutely malnourished, including more than 177,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition.

The number of food insecure people more than doubled – from 1.3 million to 2.7 million. Some 357,285 children and pregnant and lactating mothers are acutely malnourished. The latest nutrition surveys showed that three sub-counties (Turkana North, North Hor (Marsabit), Mandera) had GAM rates above 30 per cent. Six sub-counties (Turkana Central, Turkana South, Turkana West, Laisamis, East Pokot (Baringo), Isiolo) had GAM rates between 15 and 29 per cent.  \r\n\r\nMaize production in the coastal areas decreased by 99 per cent compared to the long term average. People have to travel further to access water, for example in Baringo, household walk three times longer than normal. Pastoralist communities in the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) counties are losing their livestock - with reports of large numbers of animal deaths in Turkana, Marsabit, Samburu and Mandera counties. Data collected by UNICEF from 10 affected counties indicated that close to 175,000 children were not attending early pre-primary and primary schools, primarily due to the drought’s impact. ([OCHA, 17 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1906393))\r\n\r\nMore than 2.6 million Kenyans were severely food insecure as of 26 May 2017 — and this number was rapidly rising. High levels of malnutrition are prevalent across the arid and semi-arid lands. Three sub-counties report Global Acute Malnutrition rates of 30 per cent, double the emergency threshold. Severe drought has dried up water resources in half of Kenya’s 47 counties and an estimated 3 million people lack access to clean water. Recurrent droughts have destroyed livelihoods, triggered local conflicts over scare resources and eroded the ability of communities to cope. Families are on the move, which poses protection risks for women and children. More than 1.2 million children are in need of education assistance. Kenya is experiencing multiple disease outbreaks including cholera/Acute Watery Diarrhea and measles. An estimated 2.9 million people require lifesaving medical interventions and community-based primary health outreach. ([OCHA, 26 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2049409))\r\n\r\nThe National Drought Management Authority’s (NDMA) early warning bulletin for June indicates that while the long rains have ended, many parts of the Arid and Semi-arid Lands (ASALs) are still experiencing long distances between home and water sources, unusually high food prices, and worrying levels of malnutrition. Being the third consecutive below-average rainfall season, the modest recovery conditions in some parts of ASALs are likely to be short-lived. Therefore, the upcoming dry season (June to September) will be a difficult one for the ASALs in terms of malnutrition and access to water and food, particularly for pastoral communities. Insecurity linked to resource-based conflicts has worsened, while Fall Armyworm and African Armyworm infestations continue to threaten crops in marginal agricultural counties, further worsening the prospects for the next harvest. ([UNICEF, 19 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2093059))\r\n\r\nThe Horn of Africa is experiencing one of the worst hunger crises in recent times due to a prolonged drought. The current drought is worse in a number of ways than in 2011, with some areas experiencing the failure of three rains in a row. In Kenya, 2.6 million people are experiencing crisis levels of food insecurity. The number could increase to 3.5 million in need of targeted assistance by August. In parts of Marsabit and Turkana, where communities are unable to reach sustained humanitarian assistance, they are at risk of sliding in to emergency levels of hunger (IPC Phase 4), one step away from famine, between July and September.\r\n\r\nThe March–May rains have been below average and it is likely that the July food harvests will also be below average, leading to a corresponding decline in access to and consumption of food. In addition, the African armyworm infestation has already affected around 69,000 hectares of farming land, prices of basic food commodities, such as maize, in Kenya have soared with overall inflation for the month of May 2017 reaching a five-year high of 11.7 per cent, and livestock prices in pastoralist areas are low due to the poor condition of animals. As a result people are reducing what they eat, with many families eating one meal a day. Food shortages are further compounded by anxiety around upcoming general elections which may politicize the crisis, a lack of access to water due to non-operational water points, and high levels of severe acute malnutrition among children below the age of five. ([OXFAM, 4 July 2017](https://reliefweb.int/report/kenya/kenya-drought-crisis-call-action))\r\n\r\nFollowing at least two consecutive poor rainy seasons, food security needs are expected to peak in October 2017 as food and income sources are below-average across the majority of pastoral and marginal agricultural areas. As a result, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected through early December in areas of Turkana, Marsabit, Mandera, Wajir, Isiolo, Garissa, Tana River, Samburu, and Laikipia, requiring urgent humanitarian assistance. However, an improvement to Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes is expected across all pastoral areas in early 2018; however, some of the most vulnerable households are still likely to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). ([FEWS, 18 Nov 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2333659/))\r\n\r\nIn Kenya, drought conditions that are expected to persist into 2018 have left 3.4 million people severely food insecure and an estimated 500,000 people without access to water. An estimated 482,882 children require treatment for acute malnutrition, including 104,614 who are suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Eighty-eight per cent of these children are from 23 arid and semi-arid counties. Drought conditions have led to declines in school attendance and school participation and rising dropout rates. ([UNICEF, 4 Jan 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2400909))\r\n\r\n\r\nStressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are expected to persist through September in Wajir, parts of Marsabit, Isiolo, Turkana, Garissa,\r\nMandera, and Tana River due to various factors, including livelihood recovery from drought and/or flooding, a livestock quarantine from an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever (RVF), and insecurity. However, with the favorable forecast for the October to December rainy season, further improvements are expected, which will lead to Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes across the majority of the country. ([FEWSNET, 30 Jun 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2677384))\r\n\r\nCountrywide, the historically above-average 2018 March to May long rains have continued to drive food security improvements. The marginal areas are currently supported by available harvests and are in Minimal (IPC Phase 1), and food availability will increase even further, beginning in October, with harvesting from the high and medium-producing areas. Despite significantly improved livestock productivity and above-average terms-of-trade in pastoral areas, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are expected to persist through January 2019. ([FEWSNET, 28 Sep 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2806614))\r\n\r\n In marginal agricultural areas, the October to December short rains season has been significantly below average and short rains crop production is expected to be 70 percent of average. However, surplus long rains production and re-planting of short rains crops by better-off households in some areas have sustained high agricultural labor demand and above-average terms of trade, facilitating food access for the poor. As a result, deterioration in food security is most likely to be gradual, but Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are anticipated to be widespread in the February to May 2019 period. ([FEWSNET, 14 Jan 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/2948704/))\r\n\r\nThe dry conditions and high temperatures experienced from January to March have pushed more counties into the Alarm drought stage, from one (1) in February to five (5) in March. 20 ASAL counties are reporting a worsening trend and only three (3) indicate a stable trend.

Towards the east of the country, the affected areas are along Lake Tanganyika and Lake Kivu and the disease appears to be moving towards Lake Albert in the north-east. In the central region, the disease is affecting areas along the internal lakes and along the Congo River, up to Kindu and Maniema. In the western central area, the disease is affecting areas along the Kasai River.

To be noted that while this bulletin was prepared, the completeness rate of the database shared was not of 100%. However, the overall decrease of the reported cholera incidence is clear as the incidence reduces in several provinces (notably North Kivu, South Kivu, Kongo Central, Sankuru, Tanganyika, and Ituri). The epidemic is still expanding to new areas in the Great Kasai, despite an overall reduction in the cumulative incidence. ([UNICEF, 15 Dec 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2376729))\r\n\r\nThe trend of the outbreak continues to improve nationwide.

In 2018, the incidence of cholera cases peaked in week 35 (week ending 2 September 2018) with 883 cases. Thereafter, the weekly caseload steadily decreased until week 41 (week ending 14 October 2018) when 559 cases were reported. This downward trend was mostly due to marked improvement of the cholera outbreak situation in the Kasai region. The weekly incidence then started increasing in week 42, with 706 suspected cases reported. In week 44 (week ending 4 November 2018), 828 suspected cases and 20 deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR) 2.4%) were reported, compared to 784 cases reported in week 43. The current trend is driven primarily by an escalation of the cholera outbreak in Tanganyika, Haut Katanga, Sankuru and Kasai-Oriental provinces.  \r\nAs of 4 November 2018, a total of 25 378 suspected cholera cases and 860 deaths (CFR 3.4%) were reported nation-wide, since the beginning of the year.

Moreover, the 2010-2011 crises in Cote d’Ivoire and Libya also contributed to increasing the vulnerability of hundreds of thousands of households that were deprived of the remittances of migrant workers who had fled these conflicts. Their return has also placed additional strain on their communities of return, notably in Chad, Niger and Mali. In 2012, approximately 18.7 million people were estimated to be food insecure and over one million children were at risk of dying from severe acute malnutrition.

A [three-year regional plan](https://reliefweb.int/node/634433) was developed in 2013 aiming to deliver coordinated and integrated life-saving assistance to people affected by emergencies while shaping the response to chronic needs in nine countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and The Gambia.

Humanitarian partners have requested US$1.5 billion to provide aid to 8.2 million people. While the response strategy focuses us on providing emergency, life-saving assistance, humanitarian actors are also calling for a collaborative approach to help address the deeper causes of the Lake Chad Basin crisis that include abject poverty, the impact of climate change, rapid population growth and under-investment in social services. At the Oslo conference on 24 Feb 2017, 14 donors pledged $458 million for relief in 2017 and an additional $214 million was announced for 2018 and beyond.

Despite severe infrastructure and financial constraints, concerted Haitian and international efforts have succeeded in drastically reducing the number of reported cholera cases in Haiti – down from a peak of over 350,000 reported cases for 2011, to 21,916 reported cases for 2014, from 1 January to 30 November. The persistence of cholera in Haiti is mainly due to the lack of access to clean water and appropriate sanitation facilities, and although considerable improvements have been made in this regard, Haiti continues to host the largest cholera epidemic in the Western Hemisphere. Structural issues such as weak water, sanitation and health systems enable cholera, acute diarrhoea and other waterborne diseases to persist. ([UNCT, 31 Dec 2014](https://reliefweb.int/node/803836))\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 2015, the number of suspected cases was 75 per cent higher than originally expected in the mid-term review of the 2014 Humanitarian Action Plan (i.e. 15,000). From 8 Nov to 31 Dec 2014, the total number of reported suspected cholera cases was 11 324, with 133 fatalities. This is an increase of 20 per cent compared to the same period in 2013. ([ECHO, 16 Jan 2015](https://reliefweb.int/node/807066))\r\n\r\nSuspected cholera cases reported for January to March 2015 were above those observed in early\r\n2012 (but lower than those reported in the first quarter of 2013). This was predominately due to\r\nlarge outbreaks in the metropolitan region of Port-au-Prince which then spread to other high-risk\r\nregions. According to the national authorities, 4,321 suspected cholera cases and 36 deaths were\r\nreported in January, 4,055 suspected cases and 46 deaths in February ,and 3,014 cases and 22 deaths in March.

The number of cases increased slightly compared to the same period in 2015, but the trend is downward since mid February. Nevertheless the return of the rain could be an important risk factor.

From 1st January to 15 April, the MSPP registered 5,095 suspected cholera cases and 69 related deaths, in comparison to the 12,536 suspected cases and 134 deaths for the same period in 2016. This downward trend, if maintained, is an opportunity to take this year a big step towards the elimination of the transmission, in case funding is available and rapid response is accordingly intensified. ([UNCT, 27 Apr 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2012344/))\r\n\r\nAccording to PAH/WHO, Haiti recorded 814,551 suspected cases of cholera with 9,693 deaths between October 2010 and 31 July 2017. However, since 2016, the epidemiological situation indicates a marked decrease in the transmission of the disease. According to the MSPP / DELR figures, EPI week 23 (2017) to date is officially the period with the lowest number of suspected cases ever since the outbreak of the epidemic in 2010. This situation is more remarkable given that the rainfall accumulated in April and May 2017 was equal to or even higher than the rainfall measured during the passage of Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. ([OCHA, 17 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2178064))\r\n\r\nThe efforts of humanitarian partners to achieve the objective of zero cases of cholera continues with encouraging results. Thus, between January and September 2017, the country recorded a total of 10,814 suspected cases of cholera and 107 deaths against 30,211 cases and 289 deaths for the same period of 2016, a decrease of 64.2%. The highest peak in the number of cholera cases occurred in the department of Artibonite with 64.9% of the suspected cases in the month of September followed by Centre ant Ouest departments. To contain this situation, UNICEF’s partners (ACF, ACTED, Solidarités International, and French Red Cross) mobilized teams from other departments to constitute 19 teams mixed with the Rapid Response Teams (EMIRA) of the MSPP1 in the Artibonite alone. PAHO/WHO also deployed teams to outbreak areas to strengthen response either through institutional care or community activities. However, the lack of required funding for all the components of the National Elimination Plan is a handicap and a major risk for future control of the epidemic. ([OCHA, 25 Oct 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2308814))\r\n\r\nIn Haiti, the cases reported between EW 1 and EW 50 of 2017 (13,468) represent a decrease of 68% with respect to the cases notified since EW 1 and EW 52 of 2016 (41,421) and is the lowest reported cases since the outbreak started in Haiti in October 2010 (Figure 1). Nevertheless, there are still 200–300 suspected cases reported each week. Between EW 47 and EW 50 of 2017, suspected cases were reported in 9 of the 10 Departments, although four Departments (Artibonite, Centre, Nord-Ouest and Ouest) account for 90% of the cases. In the same period, the average number of cases reported exceeded what was reported in the preceding weeks, mainly with the increases observed in the Nord (36% increase) and Nord-Ouest (19% increase) departments. Similarly and comparatively between 2016 and 2017 the number of deaths reported decreased by 65% (from 447 to 157 deaths) and represents the lowest number of deaths reported since 2010.

Currently, the major risk factors for the spread of the outbreak are holy water sites where large numbers of Christian pilgrims congregate from around the country, especially in Amhara and Tigray, and seasonal mobility of daily laborers to commercial farms. The high risk for further spread of the AWD outbreak continues due to the degradation of health determinants on the back drop of overburdened local health systems, including inadequate access to safe drinking water and internal and cross-border movements.

To mitigate the potential impact of El Niño, countries in the Pacific, including Papua New Guinea, have started to initiate preparedness activities. In 2016, at least 11 countries across the Asia-Pacific region were affected by severe weather events associated with El Niño. While the effects of El Niño have not been consistent they have generally comprised of extended dry spells or drought leading to water shortages, prolonged lean seasons and food shortages.

In the Eastern Pacific, including countries like Kiribati, Nauru, Northern Cook Islands and Tuvalu, El Niño events are usually associated with higher rainfall—likely leading to flooding, infrastructure damage and the pollution of water sources.

On 30 July, Cyclone Komen made landfall in Bangladesh, bringing strong winds and additional heavy rains to the country, which resulted in widespread flooding across 12 of the country’s 14 states and regions (Ayeyarwady, Bago, Chin, Kachin, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, Rakhine, Sagaing, Shan, Yangon). On 31 July, the President declared Chin and Rakhine states, and Magway and Sagaing regions as natural disaster zones.\r\n\r\nAccording to the National Natural Disaster Management Committee (NNDMC), 125 people were killed and some 1.7 million people were temporarily displaced by floods and landslides. Almost all of the displaced people had returned to their villages of origin by the end of September, leaving only about 10,000 people in evacuation centres (mainly in Sagaing Region and Chin State) awaiting relocation. The Government has said it expects most of these remaining displaced people to return to their villages of origin or to be relocated by the end of October, although a portion of these people may be in temporary accommodation for longer, particularly in the case of people who are going to be permanently relocated to new sites.\r\n\r\nThe NNDMC identified Hakha in Chin State, Kale in Sagaing Region, Pwintbyu in Magway Region, and Minbya and Mrauk-U in Rakhine as the five most affected townships where a total of 229,600 people were affected by the floods. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, over 1.1 million acres of farmlands have been inundated, with more than 872,000 acres destroyed, as of 4 October. So far, 495,000 acres have since been re-cultivated. Damage to crops and arable land will disrupt the planting season and pose a risk to long-term food security.\r\n\r\nWhile the water has receded in most areas, many roads and bridges were destroyed in the worst affected states and regions. The roads in Chin State were particularly badly affected and continue to pose a major logistical challenge for assessments and assistance delivery.\r\n\r\nMulti-sectoral Initial Rapid Assessments (MIRA) were conducted in 317 locations of 34 townships in Ayeyarwady, Bago, Chin, Magway, Rakhine and Sagaing, covering close to 200,000 people. Other needs assessments were also carried out in areas not covered by the MIRA assessments in Chin and Rakhine states. According to the Rakhine State Government (RSG), Buthidaung, Kyauktaw, Minbya, Maungdaw and Mrauk-U townships were the most severely affected areas in Rakhine State. In many parts of Rahine State, floods and salt water severely damaged the paddy fields. A major concern remains water contamination, as most villages use water ponds for drinking water and many ponds were flooded and contaminated.([OCHA, 4 Nov 2015](https://reliefweb.int/node/1248751))\r\n\r\nSix months on from the devastating floods that struck Myanmar, around 400,000 people have received emergency assistance and support in their recovery from the Myanmar Red Cross Society and its partners in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. At their peak the floods affected over 9 million people across 12 of Myanmar’s 14 states and regions. The floods temporarily displaced over 1.7 million people and destroyed 15,000 homes as well as more than 840,000 acres of agricultural crops.\r\n\r\nBetween July 2015 and January 2016, over 1,400 Red Cross volunteers and staff from the Myanmar Red Cross Society and Red Cross partners assisted flood affected people across the country. The first phase included evacuations, providing emergency relief such as purified water, food, household items, and shelter materials. Since then, efforts have been focused on supporting the longer term recovery of flood affected communities across the five worst hit regions of Chin, Rakhine, Sagaing, Magway and Ayerwady with livelihood activities, cleaning of contaminated ponds and wells and infrastructure rehabilitation.

([Gov\'t of Ethiopia, OCHA, 19 Oct 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2283994))\r\n\r\nDue to drought and large-scale displacement in the southern and south-eastern lowland areas of Ethiopia, humanitarian needs are expected to remain significant in 2018. As of September 2017, 1.3 million people, 64 per cent of whom are children, are displaced due to conflict and drought. The majority of these people will remain displaced in 2018. ([UNICEF, 4 Jan 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2400904))\r\n\r\nThe meher assessment findings revealed that two previous years of consecutive drought, compounded with weak rains at the end of 2017 left hundreds of thousands destitute in southern and south-eastern Ethiopia. Poor pasture regeneration and limited water source replenishment for livestock have resulted in acute humanitarian needs and will reduce traditional recovery processes among pastoralist households. Consequently, the food security situation in the lowland agro-pastoral areas is not expected to improve significantly in 2018. Overall, the good harvest in highland areas, is expected to reduce large scale needs in the northern highlands, however reduced harvest and crop loss were experienced due to erratic rainfall in some potential areas. The multi-sector humanitarian response operation established over the course of 2017 will need to be sustained in 2018. The extent of needs and the corresponding humanitarian operation will be reviewed during the belg/gu/ganna assessment in June/July. ([Gov\'t of Ethiopia, OCHA, 09 Mar 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2504064))\r\n\r\n\r\nA recent FEWS NET survey in Dollo Zone of Somali Region suggests food security and nutrition outcomes have improved significantly in areas worst affected by drought in 2016 and 2017. These improvements are largely due to improvements in seasonal performance, continued humanitarian assistance delivery, and declines in disease outbreaks. Currently, worst affected areas such as Dollo Zone and much of southeastern Somali Region are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), with humanitarian assistance preventing a further deterioration among some populations, particularly IDPs. While the risk of a deterioration beyond Emergency (IPC Phase 4) has declined, continued humanitarian assistance is needed through at least September... The 2018 Belg (March to May) rains performed very poorly over most northern Belg-producing areas, leading harvests to be as much as 40 percent below average and delayed by one to two months. ([FEWSNET, 12 Jul 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2693599))\r\n\r\nCrisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are projected to persist through at least January 2019 across large areas of Somali Region, as drought recovery continues amidst recent conflicts. In addition, ethnic conflicts in Oromia along the Somali border and between West Guji of Oromia and Gedeo of SNNPR have caused significant displacement, restricting typical access to food and income sources. As a result, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2!) outcomes, only in the presence of humanitarian assistance, are projected to continue.

Those affects are now emerging in other areas of the country, specifically in Jubaland in the south. Somaliland and Puntland have experienced below average rains for up to four seasons, spanning two years, and affecting nearly 1.4 million people. ([OCHA, 28 Nov 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1796964))\r\n\r\nThe humanitarian situation in Somalia is rapidly deteriorating and famine is a strong possibility in 2017. This comes only six years after a devastating famine led to the death of more than a quarter of a million people – half of them children. The severe drought is a result of two consecutive seasons of poor rainfall, more in some areas. In the worst affected areas, large-scale crop failure and high levels of livestock deaths are occurring. Malnutrition and drought-related diseases are on the rise, so are displacements, including to Ethiopia. Increasing competition for resources such as water is already increasing local tensions and could trigger further inter-communal conflict. Over 6.2 million people-half the population-are in need of humanitarian assistance. The situation of children of Somalia is particularly grave. ([OCHA, 17 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1907713))\r\n\r\nAs of 31 May 2017, there had been an estimated 739,000 drought displacements since November 2016...More than 480,000 of the displaced, or 65 per cent, are under the age of 18. Moreover, people under 5 years old represent more than one-quarter (195,000) of all those displaced — and are the most at risk of malnutrition and disease. ([UNHCR, 31 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2068029))\r\n\r\n3.2 million people are severely food insecure. This situation is expected to persist throughout 2017 given the high likelihood of a third consecutive poor harvest in July. Access to food is relatively better than previously projected due to large-scale humanitarian assistance...102,263 people have been treated for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) since January. SAM admissions have increased by more than 50% since 2016. The Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU)’s post-Jilaal 2017 survey indicates a high prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (15% to 30%) in the Bay, Bakool, Sool, Sanaag, Bari and Nugal regions, as well as in Baidoa and Mogadishu IDP camps. ([OCHA, 16 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2084594))\r\n\r\nWhile the latest FSNAU assessments show a decrease of the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance from 6.7 million to 6.2 million people, the threat of localized famine countered by scaled-up humanitarian response is as relevant today as it was in the first months of this crisis. The Gu harvest will provide temporary relief for some communities in terms of food availability, but the harvest is reduced due to poor rains and access to food remains constrained. Prices will remain elevated through at least early 2018. Malnutrition, one of the leading indicators of the crisis, has reached emergency levels in a number of locations in southern and central Somalia, primarily, though not exclusively among displaced populations. Overall, some 388,000 acutely malnourished children are in need of critical nutrition support, including life-saving treatment for more than 87,000 severely malnourished children. Nearly 895,000 internally displaced people due to drought and conflict rely almost exclusively on assistance for basic services and life support. Major AWD/Cholera and measles outbreaks are also of continued concern. Through robust humanitarian assistance and the modest benefits from the underperforming Gu rains, the situation has stabilized but remains of serious concern at emergency levels. Whereas there is a modest decline in the number of people in need, there is an increase in the number of persons in the emergency-phase (IPC 4) compared to the previous assessment. When the threat of famine was announced in February, the number of people in need stood at 6.2 million. ([OCHA, 31 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2197699))\r\n\r\nHumanitarian partners are closely following what could become another failed rainy season in a context of continued risk of famine and deteriorating humanitarian indicators. According to the October Rainfall Update for Somalia by the FAO-managed Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM), the Deyr 2017 rainy season, which usually runs from October to December, kicked off in the last week of September in the north eastern areas and second week of October in southern and central regions. Many places in Bay, Bakool, Gedo and Middle Juba received rains at the start of the season. ([OCHA, 30 Oct 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2299179))\r\n\r\nFood security is expected to improve for agricultural and agropastoral households in January with the Deyr harvest. In both areas, though, improvements will be short‐lived and many households will face food consumption gaps through mid‐2018. In a worst‐case scenario of an extended absence of assistance, Famine (IPC Phase 5) remains possible, and continued large‐scale assistance is needed throughout 2018 to protect lives and livelihoods. ([FEWSNET, 30 Dec 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2397224))\r\n\r\nFood security has improved significantly in many of the areas worstaffected by the 2016/17 drought, as a result of large-scale humanitarian assistance and improvements in seasonal performance. Most areas of the country are currently Stressed (IPC Phase 2), though Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes exist in some areas and among IDP populations. Between July and September, in the absence of continued humanitarian assistance, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely in riverine livelihood zones and northern and central Somalia. Emergency (IPC Phase 4) is likely in Guban Pastoral livelihood zone. ([FEWSNET, 30 Jun 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2677274))\r\n\r\nThe record levels of rainfall seen during the April – June Gu rainy season have ushered in hopes of the substantial replenishment of water resources, and the restoration of cropland and livestock numbers across many areas of Somalia. The latest food security outlook by the Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWSNET) and the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) reports that food security will improve significantly in many of the areas worst-affected by the 2016/17 drought, as a result of improvements in seasonal performance supported by large-scale humanitarian assistance. However, the magnitude and intensity of the rains, coupled with the subsequent flooding, has aggravated vulnerabilities. Vulnerable communities, still recovering from the adverse effects of protracted drought, are among those who have been most severely affected by flooding. ([OCHA, 05 Jul 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2685429))\r\n\r\nDue to the above-average rains in the first half of 2018 and sustained humanitarian assistance, the number of people facing severe food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 and above) has decreased by 52 per cent from 3.1 million in September 2017 to 1.5 million in September 2018. However, the IPC Phase 2 caseload remained virtually unchanged, with a reduction of only 0.6 per cent. Due to the mid-2018 Gu rainy season, total cereal production exceeded the long-term average (1995-2017) by approximately 17 per cent and is 58 per cent higher than the five-year average (2013-17). Favourable rainfall between April and June 2018 also improved pasture and water availability for livestock and bolstered market conditions in some areas. Notwithstanding the relative improvement in food security outcomes since the end of the 2016/17 drought, similar gains were not observed with respect to malnutrition, which is influenced by several factors, including healthcare, clean water, proper sanitation and good hygiene practices. Malnutrition rates across Somalia remain very high and, in 2019, nearly 1 million children will be acutely malnourished, including more than 177,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition.

The number of food insecure people more than doubled – from 1.3 million to 2.7 million. Some 357,285 children and pregnant and lactating mothers are acutely malnourished. The latest nutrition surveys showed that three sub-counties (Turkana North, North Hor (Marsabit), Mandera) had GAM rates above 30 per cent. Six sub-counties (Turkana Central, Turkana South, Turkana West, Laisamis, East Pokot (Baringo), Isiolo) had GAM rates between 15 and 29 per cent.  \r\n\r\nMaize production in the coastal areas decreased by 99 per cent compared to the long term average. People have to travel further to access water, for example in Baringo, household walk three times longer than normal. Pastoralist communities in the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) counties are losing their livestock - with reports of large numbers of animal deaths in Turkana, Marsabit, Samburu and Mandera counties. Data collected by UNICEF from 10 affected counties indicated that close to 175,000 children were not attending early pre-primary and primary schools, primarily due to the drought’s impact. ([OCHA, 17 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1906393))\r\n\r\nMore than 2.6 million Kenyans were severely food insecure as of 26 May 2017 — and this number was rapidly rising. High levels of malnutrition are prevalent across the arid and semi-arid lands. Three sub-counties report Global Acute Malnutrition rates of 30 per cent, double the emergency threshold. Severe drought has dried up water resources in half of Kenya’s 47 counties and an estimated 3 million people lack access to clean water. Recurrent droughts have destroyed livelihoods, triggered local conflicts over scare resources and eroded the ability of communities to cope. Families are on the move, which poses protection risks for women and children. More than 1.2 million children are in need of education assistance. Kenya is experiencing multiple disease outbreaks including cholera/Acute Watery Diarrhea and measles. An estimated 2.9 million people require lifesaving medical interventions and community-based primary health outreach. ([OCHA, 26 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2049409))\r\n\r\nThe National Drought Management Authority’s (NDMA) early warning bulletin for June indicates that while the long rains have ended, many parts of the Arid and Semi-arid Lands (ASALs) are still experiencing long distances between home and water sources, unusually high food prices, and worrying levels of malnutrition. Being the third consecutive below-average rainfall season, the modest recovery conditions in some parts of ASALs are likely to be short-lived. Therefore, the upcoming dry season (June to September) will be a difficult one for the ASALs in terms of malnutrition and access to water and food, particularly for pastoral communities. Insecurity linked to resource-based conflicts has worsened, while Fall Armyworm and African Armyworm infestations continue to threaten crops in marginal agricultural counties, further worsening the prospects for the next harvest. ([UNICEF, 19 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2093059))\r\n\r\nThe Horn of Africa is experiencing one of the worst hunger crises in recent times due to a prolonged drought. The current drought is worse in a number of ways than in 2011, with some areas experiencing the failure of three rains in a row. In Kenya, 2.6 million people are experiencing crisis levels of food insecurity. The number could increase to 3.5 million in need of targeted assistance by August. In parts of Marsabit and Turkana, where communities are unable to reach sustained humanitarian assistance, they are at risk of sliding in to emergency levels of hunger (IPC Phase 4), one step away from famine, between July and September.\r\n\r\nThe March–May rains have been below average and it is likely that the July food harvests will also be below average, leading to a corresponding decline in access to and consumption of food. In addition, the African armyworm infestation has already affected around 69,000 hectares of farming land, prices of basic food commodities, such as maize, in Kenya have soared with overall inflation for the month of May 2017 reaching a five-year high of 11.7 per cent, and livestock prices in pastoralist areas are low due to the poor condition of animals. As a result people are reducing what they eat, with many families eating one meal a day. Food shortages are further compounded by anxiety around upcoming general elections which may politicize the crisis, a lack of access to water due to non-operational water points, and high levels of severe acute malnutrition among children below the age of five. ([OXFAM, 4 July 2017](https://reliefweb.int/report/kenya/kenya-drought-crisis-call-action))\r\n\r\nFollowing at least two consecutive poor rainy seasons, food security needs are expected to peak in October 2017 as food and income sources are below-average across the majority of pastoral and marginal agricultural areas. As a result, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected through early December in areas of Turkana, Marsabit, Mandera, Wajir, Isiolo, Garissa, Tana River, Samburu, and Laikipia, requiring urgent humanitarian assistance. However, an improvement to Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes is expected across all pastoral areas in early 2018; however, some of the most vulnerable households are still likely to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). ([FEWS, 18 Nov 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2333659/))\r\n\r\nIn Kenya, drought conditions that are expected to persist into 2018 have left 3.4 million people severely food insecure and an estimated 500,000 people without access to water. An estimated 482,882 children require treatment for acute malnutrition, including 104,614 who are suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Eighty-eight per cent of these children are from 23 arid and semi-arid counties. Drought conditions have led to declines in school attendance and school participation and rising dropout rates. ([UNICEF, 4 Jan 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2400909))\r\n\r\n\r\nStressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are expected to persist through September in Wajir, parts of Marsabit, Isiolo, Turkana, Garissa,\r\nMandera, and Tana River due to various factors, including livelihood recovery from drought and/or flooding, a livestock quarantine from an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever (RVF), and insecurity. However, with the favorable forecast for the October to December rainy season, further improvements are expected, which will lead to Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes across the majority of the country. ([FEWSNET, 30 Jun 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2677384))\r\n\r\nCountrywide, the historically above-average 2018 March to May long rains have continued to drive food security improvements. The marginal areas are currently supported by available harvests and are in Minimal (IPC Phase 1), and food availability will increase even further, beginning in October, with harvesting from the high and medium-producing areas.

Given the extent of the plague, it was estimated that the food security of about 13 million people (60 percent of the population) could be affected in the absence of large-scale locust control operations. To cope with this dire situation, in December 2012, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Madagascar and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations developed a [Three-year Programme (2013–2016)](https://reliefweb.int/node/810826) in response to the locust plague. Donor response has been timely and positive. The first locust campaign was fully funded and successfully implemented. The specific objective of the campaign, aimed at halting the dynamics of the locust plague while protecting crops and pastures, was achieved. Following surveys carried out on more than 30 million ha, the locust populations in an area exceeding 1.2 million ha were controlled, without any incident affecting human health or the environment and without causing significant damage to the major rice baskets. In order to sustain the results achieved during the first campaign, it is essential to support the decline of the locust plague during the 2014/15 campaign and return, in 2016, to a locust recession situation (overall objective of the Three-year Programme), thus putting an end to the locust crises’ cycle and avoiding further deterioration of the significant food insecurity situation.

Moreover, the 2010-2011 crises in Cote d’Ivoire and Libya also contributed to increasing the vulnerability of hundreds of thousands of households that were deprived of the remittances of migrant workers who had fled these conflicts. Their return has also placed additional strain on their communities of return, notably in Chad, Niger and Mali. In 2012, approximately 18.7 million people were estimated to be food insecure and over one million children were at risk of dying from severe acute malnutrition. ([OCHA, 17 Dec 2012](https://reliefweb.int/node/551990))\r\n\r\nIn 2012, and for the third time in ten years, the Sahel region was hit by a major drought which further weakened vulnerable communities. The scale of the resulting food and nutrition crisis required all actors to join forces to save the lives of the 24 million people affected. A [three-year regional plan](https://reliefweb.int/node/634433) was developed in 2013 aiming to deliver coordinated and integrated life-saving assistance to people affected by emergencies while shaping the response to chronic needs in nine countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and The Gambia. ([OCHA, 30 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2194999))\r\n\r\n**Lake Chad Basin**: The scale of suffering remains huge and is expected to grow: around 11 million people will require assistance in 2017. Humanitarian partners have requested US$1.5 billion to provide aid to 8.2 million people. While the response strategy focuses us on providing emergency, life-saving assistance, humanitarian actors are also calling for a collaborative approach to help address the deeper causes of the Lake Chad Basin crisis that include abject poverty, the impact of climate change, rapid population growth and under-investment in social services. At the Oslo conference on 24 Feb 2017, 14 donors pledged $458 million for relief in 2017 and an additional $214 million was announced for 2018 and beyond. ([OCHA, 24 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1917023))\r\n\r\n**Mali**: Needs remain high with more than 3.5 million people being food insecure and some 852,000 people in need of nutrition assistance. More than 37,000 people remain internally displaced. The majority of those in need of assistance are in Mali’s northern region.\r\nIn April 2017, the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2017 for $293 million was only 11.6% funded.

The persistence of cholera in Haiti is mainly due to the lack of access to clean water and appropriate sanitation facilities, and although considerable improvements have been made in this regard, Haiti continues to host the largest cholera epidemic in the Western Hemisphere. Structural issues such as weak water, sanitation and health systems enable cholera, acute diarrhoea and other waterborne diseases to persist.

The situation is reported to be more critical in the towns of Carrefour (109 cases), Port-au-Prince (83 cases), Tabarre (75 cases), Mirebalais (45 cases) and Verrettes (39 cases). ([OCHA, 31 Jul 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1651856))\r\n\r\nIn October 2016, [Hurricane Matthew](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2016-000106-hti) devastated Haiti which saw an increase of cases in Grand’Anse (148 cases) , Sud (53), and North-Ouest (6 cases) , and Artibonite (28) in the aftermath. ([WHO/PAHO, 11 Oct 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1731736))\r\n\r\nOn 14 October, the UN Secretary-General established the [Haiti Cholera Response Multi-Partner Trust Fund](http://mptf.undp.org/factsheet/fund/CLH00) to finance critical priorities of the [new UN system approach to cholera in Haiti](https://reliefweb.int/node/1741086) designed to support the country in overcoming the epidemic and building sound water, sanitation and health systems.  ([UN, 14 Oct 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1738696))\r\n\r\nA new approach to cholera in Haiti was laid out in the [report by the UN Secretary-General (A/71/620)](https://reliefweb.int/node/1818109) published on 12 December 2016. The UN General Assembly welcomed and [committed](https://reliefweb.int/node/1825754) to this new approach on 16 Dec 2016.\r\n\r\nOn 6 February, the Government of Haiti and the Humanitarian Country Team...launched an [appeal](https://reliefweb.int/node/1889634) for...US$ 291.5 million to cover the critical humanitarian needs of 2.4 million people, US$ 34.7 million of which would only be for cholera. ([OCHA, 6 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1889869))  \r\n\r\nAs of 31 December 2016, Haitian and international efforts have succeeded in reducing the cholera cases and fatalities in Haiti by almost 88% since the peak in 2011 (350,000 cases). From 1st January to 15 April, the MSPP registered 5,095 suspected cholera cases and 69 related deaths, in comparison to the 12,536 suspected cases and 134 deaths for the same period in 2016. This downward trend, if maintained, is an opportunity to take this year a big step towards the elimination of the transmission, in case funding is available and rapid response is accordingly intensified. ([UNCT, 27 Apr 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2012344/))\r\n\r\nAccording to PAH/WHO, Haiti recorded 814,551 suspected cases of cholera with 9,693 deaths between October 2010 and 31 July 2017. However, since 2016, the epidemiological situation indicates a marked decrease in the transmission of the disease. According to the MSPP / DELR figures, EPI week 23 (2017) to date is officially the period with the lowest number of suspected cases ever since the outbreak of the epidemic in 2010. This situation is more remarkable given that the rainfall accumulated in April and May 2017 was equal to or even higher than the rainfall measured during the passage of Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. ([OCHA, 17 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2178064))\r\n\r\nThe efforts of humanitarian partners to achieve the objective of zero cases of cholera continues with encouraging results. Thus, between January and September 2017, the country recorded a total of 10,814 suspected cases of cholera and 107 deaths against 30,211 cases and 289 deaths for the same period of 2016, a decrease of 64.2%. The highest peak in the number of cholera cases occurred in the department of Artibonite with 64.9% of the suspected cases in the month of September followed by Centre ant Ouest departments. To contain this situation, UNICEF’s partners (ACF, ACTED, Solidarités International, and French Red Cross) mobilized teams from other departments to constitute 19 teams mixed with the Rapid Response Teams (EMIRA) of the MSPP1 in the Artibonite alone. PAHO/WHO also deployed teams to outbreak areas to strengthen response either through institutional care or community activities. However, the lack of required funding for all the components of the National Elimination Plan is a handicap and a major risk for future control of the epidemic. ([OCHA, 25 Oct 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2308814))\r\n\r\nIn Haiti, the cases reported between EW 1 and EW 50 of 2017 (13,468) represent a decrease of 68% with respect to the cases notified since EW 1 and EW 52 of 2016 (41,421) and is the lowest reported cases since the outbreak started in Haiti in October 2010 (Figure 1). Nevertheless, there are still 200–300 suspected cases reported each week. Between EW 47 and EW 50 of 2017, suspected cases were reported in 9 of the 10 Departments, although four Departments (Artibonite, Centre, Nord-Ouest and Ouest) account for 90% of the cases. In the same period, the average number of cases reported exceeded what was reported in the preceding weeks, mainly with the increases observed in the Nord (36% increase) and Nord-Ouest (19% increase) departments. Similarly and comparatively between 2016 and 2017 the number of deaths reported decreased by 65% (from 447 to 157 deaths) and represents the lowest number of deaths reported since 2010.

To mitigate the potential impact of El Niño, countries in the Pacific, including Papua New Guinea, have started to initiate preparedness activities. In 2016, at least 11 countries across the Asia-Pacific region were affected by severe weather events associated with El Niño. While the effects of El Niño have not been consistent they have generally comprised of extended dry spells or drought leading to water shortages, prolonged lean seasons and food shortages. ([OCHA, 8 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2019274/)) \r\n\r\nAccording to the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environmental Programme, a regional sustainable development body, five of eight surveyed models indicated El Niño is likely to form by the third quarter of 2017. The effects of an El Niño event are different for each country. Generally, however, El Niño events are usually associated with lower rainfall with the possibility of droughts, dust, and increased bushfires in countries like Fiji, New Caledonia, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu in the Western Pacific. In the Eastern Pacific, including countries like Kiribati, Nauru, Northern Cook Islands and Tuvalu, El Niño events are usually associated with higher rainfall—likely leading to flooding, infrastructure damage and the pollution of water sources.

As a result, some 5.6 million people in Ethiopia require emergency food assistance in 2017. In addition, 2.7 million children and pregnant and lactating mothers require supplementary feeding, 9.2 million people need support to access safe drinking water, 1.9 million households need livestock support, and 300,000 children between 6-59 months old are targeted for the treatment for severe acute malnutrition in 2017. \r\nDrought conditions are expected to peak during the dry December to March jilaal season, which is likely to lead to a sharper deterioration in livestock body conditions, and impacting milk production and nutrition status of the families that depend on livestock for their food and income. During the dry season, the response will be complemented by supplementary food based on regular screenings to ensure the most vulnerable are reached.

In the food sector the needs have been revised slightly upwards to accommodate an increase in the number of beneficiaries through the inclusion of 4 million former Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) clients in the HRD. In other sectors such as health and nutrition, needs have also continued to increase mainly due to the deteriorating nutrition situation in Somali region, increase in the number of displaced people, as well as the Fall Army Worm (FAW) outbreak that continues to ravage crops throughout the country.

Consequently, the food security situation in the lowland agro-pastoral areas is not expected to improve significantly in 2018. Overall, the good harvest in highland areas, is expected to reduce large scale needs in the northern highlands, however reduced harvest and crop loss were experienced due to erratic rainfall in some potential areas.

Currently, worst affected areas such as Dollo Zone and much of southeastern Somali Region are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), with humanitarian assistance preventing a further deterioration among some populations, particularly IDPs.

-- 	('2015-06-09T00:00:00+00:00','Drought','Somalia','Somalia: Drought - 2015-2019','The 2015-2016 El Niño phenomenon had a severe impact on vulnerable people in Somalia - it worsened an already widespread drought in Puntland and Somaliland with a devastating impact on communities and their livelihoods, increasing food insecurity, cash shortages and resulting in out-migration and death of livestock. Those affects are now emerging in other areas of the country, specifically in Jubaland in the south. Somaliland and Puntland have experienced below average rains for up to four seasons, spanning two years, and affecting nearly 1.4 million people. ([OCHA, 28 Nov 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1796964))\r\n\r\nThe humanitarian situation in Somalia is rapidly deteriorating and famine is a strong possibility in 2017. This comes only six years after a devastating famine led to the death of more than a quarter of a million people – half of them children. The severe drought is a result of two consecutive seasons of poor rainfall, more in some areas. In the worst affected areas, large-scale crop failure and high levels of livestock deaths are occurring. Malnutrition and drought-related diseases are on the rise, so are displacements, including to Ethiopia. Increasing competition for resources such as water is already increasing local tensions and could trigger further inter-communal conflict. Over 6.2 million people-half the population-are in need of humanitarian assistance. The situation of children of Somalia is particularly grave. ([OCHA, 17 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1907713))\r\n\r\nAs of 31 May 2017, there had been an estimated 739,000 drought displacements since November 2016...More than 480,000 of the displaced, or 65 per cent, are under the age of 18. Moreover, people under 5 years old represent more than one-quarter (195,000) of all those displaced — and are the most at risk of malnutrition and disease. ([UNHCR, 31 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2068029))\r\n\r\n3.2 million people are severely food insecure. This situation is expected to persist throughout 2017 given the high likelihood of a third consecutive poor harvest in July. Access to food is relatively better than previously projected due to large-scale humanitarian assistance...102,263 people have been treated for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) since January. SAM admissions have increased by more than 50% since 2016. The Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU)’s post-Jilaal 2017 survey indicates a high prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (15% to 30%) in the Bay, Bakool, Sool, Sanaag, Bari and Nugal regions, as well as in Baidoa and Mogadishu IDP camps. ([OCHA, 16 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2084594))\r\n\r\nWhile the latest FSNAU assessments show a decrease of the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance from 6.7 million to 6.2 million people, the threat of localized famine countered by scaled-up humanitarian response is as relevant today as it was in the first months of this crisis. The Gu harvest will provide temporary relief for some communities in terms of food availability, but the harvest is reduced due to poor rains and access to food remains constrained. Prices will remain elevated through at least early 2018. Malnutrition, one of the leading indicators of the crisis, has reached emergency levels in a number of locations in southern and central Somalia, primarily, though not exclusively among displaced populations. Overall, some 388,000 acutely malnourished children are in need of critical nutrition support, including life-saving treatment for more than 87,000 severely malnourished children. Nearly 895,000 internally displaced people due to drought and conflict rely almost exclusively on assistance for basic services and life support. Major AWD/Cholera and measles outbreaks are also of continued concern. Through robust humanitarian assistance and the modest benefits from the underperforming Gu rains, the situation has stabilized but remains of serious concern at emergency levels. Whereas there is a modest decline in the number of people in need, there is an increase in the number of persons in the emergency-phase (IPC 4) compared to the previous assessment. When the threat of famine was announced in February, the number of people in need stood at 6.2 million. ([OCHA, 31 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2197699))\r\n\r\nHumanitarian partners are closely following what could become another failed rainy season in a context of continued risk of famine and deteriorating humanitarian indicators. According to the October Rainfall Update for Somalia by the FAO-managed Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM), the Deyr 2017 rainy season, which usually runs from October to December, kicked off in the last week of September in the north eastern areas and second week of October in southern and central regions. Many places in Bay, Bakool, Gedo and Middle Juba received rains at the start of the season. ([OCHA, 30 Oct 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2299179))\r\n\r\nFood security is expected to improve for agricultural and agropastoral households in January with the Deyr harvest. In both areas, though, improvements will be short‐lived and many households will face food consumption gaps through mid‐2018. In a worst‐case scenario of an extended absence of assistance, Famine (IPC Phase 5) remains possible, and continued large‐scale assistance is needed throughout 2018 to protect lives and livelihoods. ([FEWSNET, 30 Dec 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2397224))\r\n\r\nFood security has improved significantly in many of the areas worstaffected by the 2016/17 drought, as a result of large-scale humanitarian assistance and improvements in seasonal performance. Most areas of the country are currently Stressed (IPC Phase 2), though Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes exist in some areas and among IDP populations. Between July and September, in the absence of continued humanitarian assistance, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely in riverine livelihood zones and northern and central Somalia. Emergency (IPC Phase 4) is likely in Guban Pastoral livelihood zone. ([FEWSNET, 30 Jun 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2677274))\r\n\r\nThe record levels of rainfall seen during the April – June Gu rainy season have ushered in hopes of the substantial replenishment of water resources, and the restoration of cropland and livestock numbers across many areas of Somalia. The latest food security outlook by the Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWSNET) and the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) reports that food security will improve significantly in many of the areas worst-affected by the 2016/17 drought, as a result of improvements in seasonal performance supported by large-scale humanitarian assistance. However, the magnitude and intensity of the rains, coupled with the subsequent flooding, has aggravated vulnerabilities. Vulnerable communities, still recovering from the adverse effects of protracted drought, are among those who have been most severely affected by flooding. ([OCHA, 05 Jul 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2685429))\r\n\r\nDue to the above-average rains in the first half of 2018 and sustained humanitarian assistance, the number of people facing severe food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 and above) has decreased by 52 per cent from 3.1 million in September 2017 to 1.5 million in September 2018. However, the IPC Phase 2 caseload remained virtually unchanged, with a reduction of only 0.6 per cent. Due to the mid-2018 Gu rainy season, total cereal production exceeded the long-term average (1995-2017) by approximately 17 per cent and is 58 per cent higher than the five-year average (2013-17). Favourable rainfall between April and June 2018 also improved pasture and water availability for livestock and bolstered market conditions in some areas. Notwithstanding the relative improvement in food security outcomes since the end of the 2016/17 drought, similar gains were not observed with respect to malnutrition, which is influenced by several factors, including healthcare, clean water, proper sanitation and good hygiene practices. Malnutrition rates across Somalia remain very high and, in 2019, nearly 1 million children will be acutely malnourished, including more than 177,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition.

([FAO, 17 Jun 2015](https://reliefweb.int/node/1041416/))  About US$6.3 million was allocated from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to respond to urgent needs. This funding has enabled UN agencies to rapidly scale up response operations and provide 1.3 million people, including 790,000 women and children, with life-saving assistance in four of the most affected provinces of South Hwanghae, North Hwanghae, South Pyongan and South Hamgyong. ([OCHA, 13 Aug 2015](https://reliefweb.int/node/1131661))\r\n\r\nOn 29 January 2016, UN Secretary-General released US$ 8 million from CERF for severely underfunded aid operations in DPR Korea. These funds will enable life-saving assistance for more than 2.2 million people most vulnerable and at risk of malnutrition. In DPR Korea, chronic malnutrition (stunting) among under-five children is at 27.9 per cent, while 4 per cent of under-five children are acutely malnourished (wasting). Around 70 per cent of the population, or 18 million people, are considered food insecure. ([OCHA, 2 Feb 2016](http://www.reliefweb.int/node/1373021))\r\n\r\nThe 2015 main season food crop production is estimated at 4.78 million tonnes, 11 percent below 2014’s output. The decrease is mostly attributed to a 26 percent drop in paddy production, estimated at 1.95 million tonnes, due to lingering precipitation deficits and low water availabilities for irrigation...The monthly average rations since July 2015 were below those distributed during the same period in 2014 and the average level between 2011/12 and 2013/14. PDS rations, set at 370 grams/ person/day between January and March 2016, were reduced to 360 grams/person/day since April. This is the lowest rate since 2010/11, and well below the Government’s target of 573 grams/person/day, mainly due to an overall shortage of food in the country.

The number of food insecure people more than doubled – from 1.3 million to 2.7 million. Some 357,285 children and pregnant and lactating mothers are acutely malnourished. The latest nutrition surveys showed that three sub-counties (Turkana North, North Hor (Marsabit), Mandera) had GAM rates above 30 per cent. Six sub-counties (Turkana Central, Turkana South, Turkana West, Laisamis, East Pokot (Baringo), Isiolo) had GAM rates between 15 and 29 per cent.  \r\n\r\nMaize production in the coastal areas decreased by 99 per cent compared to the long term average. People have to travel further to access water, for example in Baringo, household walk three times longer than normal. Pastoralist communities in the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) counties are losing their livestock - with reports of large numbers of animal deaths in Turkana, Marsabit, Samburu and Mandera counties. Data collected by UNICEF from 10 affected counties indicated that close to 175,000 children were not attending early pre-primary and primary schools, primarily due to the drought’s impact. ([OCHA, 17 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1906393))\r\n\r\nMore than 2.6 million Kenyans were severely food insecure as of 26 May 2017 — and this number was rapidly rising. High levels of malnutrition are prevalent across the arid and semi-arid lands. Three sub-counties report Global Acute Malnutrition rates of 30 per cent, double the emergency threshold. Severe drought has dried up water resources in half of Kenya’s 47 counties and an estimated 3 million people lack access to clean water. Recurrent droughts have destroyed livelihoods, triggered local conflicts over scare resources and eroded the ability of communities to cope. Families are on the move, which poses protection risks for women and children. More than 1.2 million children are in need of education assistance. Kenya is experiencing multiple disease outbreaks including cholera/Acute Watery Diarrhea and measles. An estimated 2.9 million people require lifesaving medical interventions and community-based primary health outreach. ([OCHA, 26 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2049409))\r\n\r\nThe National Drought Management Authority’s (NDMA) early warning bulletin for June indicates that while the long rains have ended, many parts of the Arid and Semi-arid Lands (ASALs) are still experiencing long distances between home and water sources, unusually high food prices, and worrying levels of malnutrition. Being the third consecutive below-average rainfall season, the modest recovery conditions in some parts of ASALs are likely to be short-lived. Therefore, the upcoming dry season (June to September) will be a difficult one for the ASALs in terms of malnutrition and access to water and food, particularly for pastoral communities. Insecurity linked to resource-based conflicts has worsened, while Fall Armyworm and African Armyworm infestations continue to threaten crops in marginal agricultural counties, further worsening the prospects for the next harvest. ([UNICEF, 19 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2093059))\r\n\r\nThe Horn of Africa is experiencing one of the worst hunger crises in recent times due to a prolonged drought. The current drought is worse in a number of ways than in 2011, with some areas experiencing the failure of three rains in a row. In Kenya, 2.6 million people are experiencing crisis levels of food insecurity. The number could increase to 3.5 million in need of targeted assistance by August. In parts of Marsabit and Turkana, where communities are unable to reach sustained humanitarian assistance, they are at risk of sliding in to emergency levels of hunger (IPC Phase 4), one step away from famine, between July and September.\r\n\r\nThe March–May rains have been below average and it is likely that the July food harvests will also be below average, leading to a corresponding decline in access to and consumption of food. In addition, the African armyworm infestation has already affected around 69,000 hectares of farming land, prices of basic food commodities, such as maize, in Kenya have soared with overall inflation for the month of May 2017 reaching a five-year high of 11.7 per cent, and livestock prices in pastoralist areas are low due to the poor condition of animals. As a result people are reducing what they eat, with many families eating one meal a day. Food shortages are further compounded by anxiety around upcoming general elections which may politicize the crisis, a lack of access to water due to non-operational water points, and high levels of severe acute malnutrition among children below the age of five. ([OXFAM, 4 July 2017](https://reliefweb.int/report/kenya/kenya-drought-crisis-call-action))\r\n\r\nFollowing at least two consecutive poor rainy seasons, food security needs are expected to peak in October 2017 as food and income sources are below-average across the majority of pastoral and marginal agricultural areas. As a result, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected through early December in areas of Turkana, Marsabit, Mandera, Wajir, Isiolo, Garissa, Tana River, Samburu, and Laikipia, requiring urgent humanitarian assistance. However, an improvement to Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes is expected across all pastoral areas in early 2018; however, some of the most vulnerable households are still likely to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). ([FEWS, 18 Nov 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2333659/))\r\n\r\nIn Kenya, drought conditions that are expected to persist into 2018 have left 3.4 million people severely food insecure and an estimated 500,000 people without access to water. An estimated 482,882 children require treatment for acute malnutrition, including 104,614 who are suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Eighty-eight per cent of these children are from 23 arid and semi-arid counties. Drought conditions have led to declines in school attendance and school participation and rising dropout rates. ([UNICEF, 4 Jan 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2400909))\r\n\r\n\r\nStressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are expected to persist through September in Wajir, parts of Marsabit, Isiolo, Turkana, Garissa,\r\nMandera, and Tana River due to various factors, including livelihood recovery from drought and/or flooding, a livestock quarantine from an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever (RVF), and insecurity. However, with the favorable forecast for the October to December rainy season, further improvements are expected, which will lead to Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes across the majority of the country. ([FEWSNET, 30 Jun 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2677384))\r\n\r\nCountrywide, the historically above-average 2018 March to May long rains have continued to drive food security improvements. The marginal areas are currently supported by available harvests and are in Minimal (IPC Phase 1), and food availability will increase even further, beginning in October, with harvesting from the high and medium-producing areas. Despite significantly improved livestock productivity and above-average terms-of-trade in pastoral areas, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are expected to persist through January 2019. ([FEWSNET, 28 Sep 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2806614))\r\n\r\n In marginal agricultural areas, the October to December short rains season has been significantly below average and short rains crop production is expected to be 70 percent of average. However, surplus long rains production and re-planting of short rains crops by better-off households in some areas have sustained high agricultural labor demand and above-average terms of trade, facilitating food access for the poor. As a result, deterioration in food security is most likely to be gradual, but Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are anticipated to be widespread in the February to May 2019 period. ([FEWSNET, 14 Jan 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/2948704/))\r\n\r\nThe dry conditions and high temperatures experienced from January to March have pushed more counties into the Alarm drought stage, from one (1) in February to five (5) in March. 20 ASAL counties are reporting a worsening trend and only three (3) indicate a stable trend.

Poverty is endemic in the sparsely populated district with acute malnutrition rates in children as high as 20 per cent, well above the emergency threshold of 15 per cent. The outbreak of sheep pox has aggravated the situation in Tharparkar, possibly having killed thousands of small animals, critical to household food security. ([OCHA, 20 March 2014](https://reliefweb.int/node/646370))\r\n\r\nMore than 190 children have died and 22,000 have been hospitalised in Tharparkar district in 2016 because of drought-related waterborne and viral diseases. Tharparkar is facing severe drought for the fourth consecutive year, and access to health services is reported to be very difficult, with families travelling an average distance of 17km to reach the nearest health facility. ([Assessment Capacities Project, 16 Feb 2016](http://www.reliefweb.int/node/1396391))\r\n\r\nAccording to the Joint UN Needs Assessment, several districts have been severely affected by extreme water scarcity (62% in Jamshoro and 100% in Tharparkar), and it has resulted in reduced harvest by 34-53% and livestock by 48%. ([UNICEF, 30 Jun 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1595461))\r\n\r\nIn Tharparkar District and the surrounding areas of Sindh Province, a third consecutive year of cereal production shortfalls due to drought, coupled with losses of small animals, has aggravated food insecurity and caused acute malnutrition. ([FAO, 30 Nov 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1806214))\r\n\r\nSince 2013, Tharparkar has been affected by a drought‐like situation impacting livelihoods, nutrition and health conditions.

According to media reports, the incidence of under‐five deaths in Tharparkar is still on rise during the first half of 2016 with 243 deaths recorded. This may suggest a worsening health and nutrition situation following the start of the drought period. ([WFP, 19 Sep 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1713536))\r\n\r\nAt least nine more infants died due to malnutrition and the outbreak of various diseases in arid Tharparkar district over a two-day period in December, raising the toll to 476 for 2016, according to local media.

The mission found that the vulnerabilities outlined in an [August 2016 needs assessment](https://reliefweb.int/node/1670556/) remain, while recommendations from detailed assessments and missions conducted from 2015-2016 have not been put into practice. ([UNCT, 17 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1939704))\r\n\r\nIn the districts of Tharparkar, Umerkot and Sanghar in southeastern Sindh Province, below-average rains throughout 2016 sharply reduced the 2016/17 cereal production. This, coupled with losses of small animals due to diseases and severe shortages of fodder and water, has aggravated food insecurity and caused acute malnutrition. ([FAO, 09 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2024489))\r\n\r\nForecast models indicate that there is a 50 to 60 per cent probability of an El Niño event developing in the second half of 2017, with Pakistan categorized as a high-risk country.

The overall case fatality rate nationally from these districts stands at 3.2%. It is estimated that 217,350 persons (38,128 households) in the affected sub-counties are at high risk of cholera infection during this outbreak, with a wider population of 900,500 people in the districts also seen as at risk due to the high mobility of people in the area. Many of the affected communities are fishing communities where lack of clean water coupled with poor sanitation and hygiene practices have contributed to the outbreak and spread of the disease. ([IFRC, 15 May 2013](https://reliefweb.int/node/576384))\r\n\r\nThis DREF operation enabled URCS to expand on its intervention and complement with enhanced awareness raising activities. The operation contributed to increased public awareness about cholera (signs and symptoms, transmission risk factors, actions for suspected cases, its prevention and control measures) for 900,500 people at risk in the affected districts. The intervention also contributed to improve early detection, reporting and referral of suspected cholera cases through community based disease surveillance mechanisms. In addition, the response improved access to safe water and awareness around sanitation and hygiene practices for 4,000 vulnerable families (18,700 people) in the affected areas, specifically around hand washing practices, use of latrines, drinking of aqua safe treated or boiled water.\r\n\r\nA preliminary final report was issued on 2 June 2014 pending the final financial report which is now available.

Given the extent of the plague, it was estimated that the food security of about 13 million people (60 percent of the population) could be affected in the absence of large-scale locust control operations. To cope with this dire situation, in December 2012, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Madagascar and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations developed a [Three-year Programme (2013–2016)](https://reliefweb.int/node/810826) in response to the locust plague. Donor response has been timely and positive. The first locust campaign was fully funded and successfully implemented. The specific objective of the campaign, aimed at halting the dynamics of the locust plague while protecting crops and pastures, was achieved. Following surveys carried out on more than 30 million ha, the locust populations in an area exceeding 1.2 million ha were controlled, without any incident affecting human health or the environment and without causing significant damage to the major rice baskets. In order to sustain the results achieved during the first campaign, it is essential to support the decline of the locust plague during the 2014/15 campaign and return, in 2016, to a locust recession situation (overall objective of the Three-year Programme), thus putting an end to the locust crises’ cycle and avoiding further deterioration of the significant food insecurity situation.

Depuis le début de cette campagne, le 09 octobre 2014, et jusqu’au 12 juillet 2015, des infestations acridiennes ont été maîtrisées sur une superficie totale de 638 531 hectares (dont 98 pour cent par voie aérienne), dans le respect de la santé humaine et de l’environnement.

Selon les prévisions, de l’ordre de 350 000 hectares devraient avoir à être traités durant cette dernière campagne antiacridienne pour revenir à une situation de rémission acridienne, son principal objectif comme la finalité du Programme triennal.

Moreover, the 2010-2011 crises in Cote d’Ivoire and Libya also contributed to increasing the vulnerability of hundreds of thousands of households that were deprived of the remittances of migrant workers who had fled these conflicts. Their return has also placed additional strain on their communities of return, notably in Chad, Niger and Mali. In 2012, approximately 18.7 million people were estimated to be food insecure and over one million children were at risk of dying from severe acute malnutrition. ([OCHA, 17 Dec 2012](https://reliefweb.int/node/551990))\r\n\r\nIn 2012, and for the third time in ten years, the Sahel region was hit by a major drought which further weakened vulnerable communities. The scale of the resulting food and nutrition crisis required all actors to join forces to save the lives of the 24 million people affected. A [three-year regional plan](https://reliefweb.int/node/634433) was developed in 2013 aiming to deliver coordinated and integrated life-saving assistance to people affected by emergencies while shaping the response to chronic needs in nine countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and The Gambia. ([OCHA, 30 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2194999))\r\n\r\n**Lake Chad Basin**: The scale of suffering remains huge and is expected to grow: around 11 million people will require assistance in 2017. Humanitarian partners have requested US$1.5 billion to provide aid to 8.2 million people. While the response strategy focuses us on providing emergency, life-saving assistance, humanitarian actors are also calling for a collaborative approach to help address the deeper causes of the Lake Chad Basin crisis that include abject poverty, the impact of climate change, rapid population growth and under-investment in social services. At the Oslo conference on 24 Feb 2017, 14 donors pledged $458 million for relief in 2017 and an additional $214 million was announced for 2018 and beyond. ([OCHA, 24 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1917023))\r\n\r\n**Mali**: Needs remain high with more than 3.5 million people being food insecure and some 852,000 people in need of nutrition assistance. More than 37,000 people remain internally displaced. The majority of those in need of assistance are in Mali’s northern region.\r\nIn April 2017, the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2017 for $293 million was only 11.6% funded. OCHA warned of destabilizing consequences, as the humanitarian situation is quickly deteriorating as a direct result of the conflict.

Despite severe infrastructure and financial constraints, concerted Haitian and international efforts have succeeded in drastically reducing the number of reported cholera cases in Haiti – down from a peak of over 350,000 reported cases for 2011, to 21,916 reported cases for 2014, from 1 January to 30 November. The persistence of cholera in Haiti is mainly due to the lack of access to clean water and appropriate sanitation facilities, and although considerable improvements have been made in this regard, Haiti continues to host the largest cholera epidemic in the Western Hemisphere. Structural issues such as weak water, sanitation and health systems enable cholera, acute diarrhoea and other waterborne diseases to persist. ([UNCT, 31 Dec 2014](https://reliefweb.int/node/803836))\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 2015, the number of suspected cases was 75 per cent higher than originally expected in the mid-term review of the 2014 Humanitarian Action Plan (i.e. 15,000).

This was predominately due to\r\nlarge outbreaks in the metropolitan region of Port-au-Prince which then spread to other high-risk\r\nregions.

However, since 2016, the epidemiological situation indicates a marked decrease in the transmission of the disease. According to the MSPP / DELR figures, EPI week 23 (2017) to date is officially the period with the lowest number of suspected cases ever since the outbreak of the epidemic in 2010. This situation is more remarkable given that the rainfall accumulated in April and May 2017 was equal to or even higher than the rainfall measured during the passage of Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. ([OCHA, 17 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2178064))\r\n\r\nThe efforts of humanitarian partners to achieve the objective of zero cases of cholera continues with encouraging results. Thus, between January and September 2017, the country recorded a total of 10,814 suspected cases of cholera and 107 deaths against 30,211 cases and 289 deaths for the same period of 2016, a decrease of 64.2%. The highest peak in the number of cholera cases occurred in the department of Artibonite with 64.9% of the suspected cases in the month of September followed by Centre ant Ouest departments. To contain this situation, UNICEF’s partners (ACF, ACTED, Solidarités International, and French Red Cross) mobilized teams from other departments to constitute 19 teams mixed with the Rapid Response Teams (EMIRA) of the MSPP1 in the Artibonite alone. PAHO/WHO also deployed teams to outbreak areas to strengthen response either through institutional care or community activities. However, the lack of required funding for all the components of the National Elimination Plan is a handicap and a major risk for future control of the epidemic. ([OCHA, 25 Oct 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2308814))\r\n\r\nIn Haiti, the cases reported between EW 1 and EW 50 of 2017 (13,468) represent a decrease of 68% with respect to the cases notified since EW 1 and EW 52 of 2016 (41,421) and is the lowest reported cases since the outbreak started in Haiti in October 2010 (Figure 1). Nevertheless, there are still 200–300 suspected cases reported each week. Between EW 47 and EW 50 of 2017, suspected cases were reported in 9 of the 10 Departments, although four Departments (Artibonite, Centre, Nord-Ouest and Ouest) account for 90% of the cases. In the same period, the average number of cases reported exceeded what was reported in the preceding weeks, mainly with the increases observed in the Nord (36% increase) and Nord-Ouest (19% increase) departments.

Rainfall and damage across such a large part of the country was a phenomenon not seen since 1948.

The eruption closed the international airport, and large amounts of volcanic ash covered fields and clogged water drainage systems.
